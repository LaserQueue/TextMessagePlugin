# TextMessagePlugin
A plugin for [LaserQueue](https://github.com/LaserQueue/LaserQueue) v0.0.5 or greater that adds texting people whose jobs are coming up. Currently a work in progress, as 0.0.5 is in development.

This plugin will add an optional phone number submission to every job. This number will get texted when the job reaches second-to-top in the queue, so they can be prepared for their cut. This will reduce turnover time at the lasercutter.

To install, clone this repository (or download as zip and decompress) into the plugins directory of LaserQueue.
